### **General Instructions:**

**Implementation of Dynamic Routing Protocol**  

### Procedure  

#### RIP Protocol  

1. Click on **New Graph** button – clicking on it will generate a graph randomly from the already stored 3 graphs in the system (each containing 5 nodes).  
2. As soon as the new graph is added, the initial table will be created automatically, initially depicting the directly connected nodes.  
3. Continue clicking the **Update** button until all tables are updated.  
4. To add an extra edge, specify the source and destination along with the weight to connect the two nodes and click the **Submit** button.  
5. After the new edges have been added, click the **Update** button again.  
6. To send a data packet, provide the source node and destination node in the space provided and click the **Send Message** button.  
7. The best path will be chosen and displayed using **red lines**.  

#### OSPF Protocol  

1. Click on **New Graph** button – clicking on it will generate a graph randomly from the already stored 3 graphs in the system (each containing 5 nodes).  
2. As soon as the new graph is added, the initial table will be created automatically, initially depicting the directly connected nodes.  
3. Click on the **Update** button for each node table separately to get the final table, which depicts the shortest route between indirectly connected nodes as well (using **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**).  
4. To add an extra edge, specify the source and destination along with the weight to connect the two nodes and click the **Submit** button.  
5. After the new edges have been added, again update the table by clicking the **Update** button.  
6. To send a data packet, provide the source node and destination node in the space provided and click the **Send Message** button.  
7. The best path will be chosen and displayed using **red lines**.
